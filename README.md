![Day02](/02_waffle/Day02.png)

ggplot2 waffle

- Code: [Day02.R](/02_waffle/Day02.R)
- Packages used: tidyverse (ggplot2, plyr), rvest, janitor, patchwork, [liamgilbey/ggwaffle](https://github.com/liamgilbey/ggwaffle)
- Data sources: Wikipedia lists of single-movie box office gross revenues; ex. [year of 1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_1969_box_office_number-one_films_in_the_United_States)
- Notes: 
	- Legend output has a bug I couldn't work around.
	- Some months have 6 weeks (vs. usual 4-5 weeks) in length. This impacts the "ease" of looking at the visual. 
	- Color choice could use some work.
